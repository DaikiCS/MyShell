My Shell

# About:
This is a project in Unix Systems Programming, which is a personal shell that is customized to my own needs. However, this is not the complete shell and lacks certain features that a normal shell has. I added functionalities such as redirection (< & >) and the built-in commands to replicate some of the commands already available on the command-line.

1. How to compile: 
2. How to execute: run ssh file
3. Expected output: shell runs inside the shell in which this program is excuted
4. Known issues: lacks certain features that a normal shell has

# What I learned:
I learned the fundamentals and what a modern Linux shell architecture requires.
